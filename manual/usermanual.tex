EPANET can also be run as a console application from the command line within a
DOS window. In this case network input data are placed into a text file and results
are written to a text file. The command line for running EPANET in this fashion is:
epanet2d inpfile rptfile outfile
Here inpfile is the name of the input file, rptfile is the name of the output
report file, and outfile is the name of an optional binary output file that stores
results in a special binary format. If the latter file is not needed then just the input and
report file names should be supplied. As written, the above command assumes that
you are working in the directory in which EPANET was installed or that this
directory has been added to the PATH statement in your AUTOEXEC.BAT file.
Otherwise full pathnames for the executable epanet2d.exe and the files on the
command line must be used. The error messages for command line EPANET  are listed in Appendix B.
