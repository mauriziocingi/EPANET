\chapter{Input File Format}
The input file for EPANET has the same format as the text file that
Windows EPANET generates from its File Export  Network command. 

It is organized in sections, where each section begins with a keyword enclosed in
brackets. The various keywords are listed in table \ref{tab:keywords}.



\begin{table}[tbp]
  \input{tex/keywords}
  \caption{keywords used in inpfile}
  \label{tab:keywords}

\end{table}

The order of sections is not important. However, whenever a node or link is referred
to in a section it must have already been defined in the [JUNCTIONS],
[RESERVOIRS], [TANKS], [PIPES], [PUMPS], or [VALVES] sections. Thus it is
recommended that these sections be placed first, right after the [TITLE] section. The
network map and tags sections are not used by EPANET and can be
eliminated from the file.Each section can contain one or more lines of data. Blank lines can appear anywhere
in the file and the semicolon (;) can be used to indicate that what follows on the line
is a comment, not data. A maximum of 255 characters can appear on a line. The ID
labels used to identify nodes, links, curves and patterns can be any combination of up
to 31 characters and numbers.
