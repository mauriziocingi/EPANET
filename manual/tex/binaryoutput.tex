\chapter{Binary Output File Format}
If a third file name is supplied to the command line that runs EPANET then the
results for all parameters for all nodes and links for all reporting time periods will be
saved to this file in a special binary format. This file can be used for special postprocessing
purposes. Data written to the file are 4-byte integers, 4-byte floats, or
fixed-size strings whose size is a multiple of 4 bytes. This allows the file to be
divided conveniently into 4-byte records. The file consists of four sections of the
following sizes in bytes:
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|}
\hline
Section &Size in bytes\\
\hline
Prolog& $852 + 20\cdot Nnodes + 36\cdot Nlinks + 8\cdot Ntanks$   \\
Energy Use& $28\cdot Npumps + 4 $   \\
Extended Period& $(16\cdot Nnodes + 32\cdot Nlinks)*Nperiods$ \\
Epilog& 28 \\
\hline
\end{tabular}

\begin{tabular}{l l }
$Nnodes$ & number of nodes (junctions + reservoirs + tanks) \\
$Nlinks$ & number of links (pipes + pumps + valves)\\
$Ntanks$ & number of tanks and reservoirs\\
$Npumps$ & number of pumps\\
$Nperiods$& number of reporting periods\\
\end{tabular}

All of these counts are themselves written to the file's Prolog or Epilog sections.
